During the workshop, we will delve into how DC distribution fits into EV fleets, utilities, electrical vehicles, and aerospace. By examining future trends, we aim to drive research and product development in this exciting area.

## Day 1: Understanding the Market

On Day 1, we will work alongside potential customers and collaborators to gain insights into current research, market trends, and barriers to expansion. This non-confidential day will feature multiple experts and guest speakers, fostering improved relationships with industry collaborators and potential partners. We will also acknowledge the importance of DOE, DOD, and the national labs.

## Day 2: Defining Opportunity Spaces

Day 2 will focus on defining the opportunity spaces for DC distribution and DC protection devices, such as solid-state and hybrid circuit breakers and contactors. We will explore the potential costs and benefits, answer the question "Why Eaton," and identify areas of alignment. By the end of the day, we aim to have a clear target space for increased research and product development efforts.
