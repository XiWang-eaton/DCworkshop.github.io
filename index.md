Welcome to the Workshop on the Future of DC Distribution Systems for Stationary and Mobile Applications. This leadership effort aims to understand and drive the DC distribution and protection requirements of emerging DC distribution in various applications. Join us as we explore the technology, applications, and potential business opportunities in this field.


Background: As part of Eaton's ongoing growth, continuous innovation is crucial. By defining specific market goals and drawing boundaries around them, we can take repeated "shots on goal" to increase our organization's ability to learn, adapt, and make smarter investments. This workshop is an important step towards growing a new business unit.
