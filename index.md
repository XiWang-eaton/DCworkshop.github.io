Welcome to the Workshop on the Future of DC Distribution Systems for Stationary and Mobile Applications. This leadership effort aims to understand and drive the DC distribution and protection requirements of emerging DC distribution in various applications. Join us as we explore the technology, applications, and potential business opportunities in this field.

During the workshop, we will delve into how DC distribution fits into EV fleets, utilities, electrical vehicles, and aerospace. By examining future trends, we aim to drive research and product development in this exciting area.

## Day 1: Understanding the Market

On Day 1, we will work alongside potential customers and collaborators to gain insights into current research, market trends, and barriers to expansion. This non-confidential day will feature multiple experts and guest speakers, fostering improved relationships with industry collaborators and potential partners. We will also acknowledge the importance of DOE, DOD, and the national labs.

## Day 2: Defining Opportunity Spaces

Day 2 will focus on defining the opportunity spaces for DC distribution and DC protection devices, such as solid-state and hybrid circuit breakers and contactors. We will explore the potential costs and benefits, answer the question "Why Eaton," and identify areas of alignment. By the end of the day, we aim to have a clear target space for increased research and product development efforts.

Background: As part of Eaton's ongoing growth, continuous innovation is crucial. By defining specific market goals and drawing boundaries around them, we can take repeated "shots on goal" to increase our organization's ability to learn, adapt, and make smarter investments. This workshop is an important step towards growing a new business unit.

You have been selected to join us at this important event. As participants are identified over the coming weeks, additional invitations will be sent by the organizing team.
