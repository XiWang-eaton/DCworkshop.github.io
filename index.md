The workshop is part of a leadership effort focused on understanding and driving DC distribution and protection requirements of emerging DC distribution in stationary and mobile applications. The workshop will focus on exploration of technology, application, and demarcation of potential future business and product line opportunities. During this workshop we will look at how DC distribution will fit into EV fleets, utilities, Inside the electrical vehicles, and aerospace and see how the future trends can drive research and product development.   

 

The goal of Day 1 is to focus on working alongside potential customers and collaborators to understand current research, market trends, and existing barriers to expansion of this future market space.  Day 1 is a non-confidential day that brings in multiple experts and guest speakers for a day of learning.  Emphasis will be on achieving a broad understanding of the impact of DC protection and distribution on Eaton and our future competitors in a symposium type environment that will foster improved relationships with industry collaborators and potential future partners, while also acknowledging the importance of DOE, DOD and the national labs. 

 
The goal of Day 2 is to focus on defining the opportunity spaces for DC distribution and DC protection devices such as, solid state and hybrid circuit breakers and contactors. The effort will focus on establishing the potential costs and benefits, answer the question “Why Eaton”, and demarcate the boundaries where there is greatest alignment.  By the end of the day, the goal is to have identified the boundaries of a target space where we can increase our research and product development efforts.  

 

Background: As part of Eaton’s goal of ongoing growth, there is a need for continuous innovation.  To increase the company’s return on innovation, there is a focus on defining specific market goals and drawing boundaries around them such that we can take repeated “shots on goal”.  This enables each shot to increase the organization’s ability to learn, re-aim, and continue to make smarter and smarter investments and grow the opportunity to a new business unit.  

  

You have been selected to join us at this important event.  As participants are identified over the coming weeks, additional invitations will be sent by the organizing team.
