Welcome to the Workshop on the Future of DC Distribution Systems for Stationary and Mobile Applications. This joint NREL-Eaton effort aims to understand and drive the DC distribution and protection requirements of emerging high-power DC distribution in various applications. Join us as we explore the technologies, applications, and potential business opportunities in this field.

Background: As part of Eaton’s ongoing growth, continuous innovation is crucial. By defining specific market goals and drawing boundaries around them, we can take repeated “shots on goal” to increase our organization’s ability to learn, adapt, and make smarter investments. This workshop is an important step towards understanding the DC distribution and protection requirements in the emerging markets.

You have been identified as an expert in this area to join us at this important event. As participants are identified over the coming weeks, additional invitations will be sent by the organizing team.
